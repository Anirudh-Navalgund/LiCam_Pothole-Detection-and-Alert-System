**LiCam** is an intelligent pothole detection and alert system using camera and 2D LiDAR. The system works well in good lighting conditions by leveraging camera's (YOLOv8) detection and during low-lit conditions using 2D-LiDAR's depth data. The system gives real-time voice instructions to the driver to safely avoid the pothole and maneuver around it. This ensures accurate detection and immediate alert mechanism even during low visibility scenarios.
